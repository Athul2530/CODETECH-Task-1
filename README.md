Overview of the Project

Project: Credit Card Fraud Detection

Objective 
The objective of this project is to develop a model to detect fraudulent credit card transactions. The goal is to use various machine learning algorithms to classify transactions as fraudulent or legitimate, thereby helping financial institutions minimize losses.

Key Activities 
- Data Preprocessing: Cleaning and preparing the dataset to handle missing values, outliers, and imbalanced classes.
- Feature Engineering: Creating new features from existing data to improve model performance.
- Model Training: Building and training different machine learning models (e.g., Logistic Regression, Random Forest, Neural Networks).
- Model Evaluation: Evaluating the performance of the models using metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.

Dataset
- Link:(https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/mlg-ulb/creditcardfraud)

Technologies Used
- Python: The primary programming language for data analysis.
- pandas: Used for data manipulation and analysis.
- scikit-learn: Used for implementing machine learning algorithms.
- matplotlib & seaborn: Used for data visualization.
